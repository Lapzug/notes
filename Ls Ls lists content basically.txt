Regex (^[0-9]+$):
A regular expression (regex) is a pattern used to match text.
^[0-9]+$ ensures that input contains only digits (0-9), and nothing else.
^: Start of input
[0-9]: Any digit
+: One or more digits
$: End of input
[[ ]] and !~:
[[ ]]: Used to test conditions safely in Bash.
!~: "Does not match". For example, [[ ! $age_years =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] checks if the input is not a number.
Arithmetic Calculation ($(( ))):
$(( )) is used for math in Bash.
For example, age_days=$((age_years * 365)) calculates days by multiplying years by 365.
